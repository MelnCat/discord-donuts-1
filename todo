More important:
  cancel command should log the number of orders to the kitchen
  cook command should log the number of orders to the kitchen
  add support for preloaded donuts
  stop people from ordering multiple donuts at once
alert command doesn't work
both blacklist commands should check that the ID being blacklisted is a valid id

Less important:

  generateTicket function should specify the claimer
  message to user from cook command doesn't show discriminator
  list command should show order statuses
